				<h3> Library Approach and Evaluation </h3>
				<h4>02.21.2017</h4>
				<p>The library that I decided to explore was <a href="https://parall.ax/products/jspdf">"jsPDF"</a> which creates
					a pdf document from html5 code and javascript. My main concern when I
					first approached the assignment, was how I was going to get the document
					to save when the user has added their own text. My first approach was
					getting the text input to appear on the pdf, and the connect the save
					pdf function to connect with the submit button. So far the I have the
					pdf generating, however, I have get to explore its graphic capabilities.
					The functions and language of the library is easy and to the point,
					however the tools and online examples the creator provided, is missing
					some basic instructions, such as linking the save function to the
					submit button. Sure it is simple enough for someone well versed in
					code to figure, out, however not for someone just learning the code.

				<h2>Studio 4 Blog</h2>
				<h3>3 Aspects for Effective and Interesting Interface Design </h3>
				<h4>02.14.2017</h4>
				<p>The picture below is what I have so far for my studio 4 interface. I plan
				on adding the tool tips to appear after the user has hovered over the pictures of the beakers and flasks.
				The tool tips will tell them that clicking the beakers once will fill the beaker with solution
				and then a seocnd time will empty the beaker into the flask. The flask can be clicked to fill when both beakers
				have been clicked twice. When the flask is clicked once it will fill and then with a second click
				a boiling audio is played for a set amount of seconds. The fading and apearence of the liquid in the containers
				will be controlled by a timer. Since this is more like an interactive graphic I plan to place everythign to be centered
			 	and the buttons I plan to add to be round an friendly also.</p>

				<h2>01.12.2017</h2>
				<p>I tend to not use social media platforms as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. However, I am on <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> most often. My view on Tumblr current user interface is mixed. On one hand I really like the visual path the designers went with. The dark blue background, and the use of white to indicate content really catches my attention and bring emphasis to what parts of the screen I am interested in. The simple, smooth, and clean rounded edges of the clickable items also made the interface very friendly to me and not overwhelming. The use of solid bright colors to categorize clickable items also had made the interface more friendly. However, this appeal is only really present in the login, dashboard, and setting areas of the website. When one goes to other areas such as exploring or searching posts under a tag, so many elements are shown, and the interface no longer seems friendly and simple. Instead it seems cluttered and personally, overwhelming to may senses (this is also why I do not really enjoy using the Facebook interface). Also another nitpick that I have with how the interface is designed, is the use of endless scroll in certain areas of the site. I can see the advantages to endless scroll and the continuous uploading of new material without a break in viewing. However, this method of pulling up and viewing material only works well for fast and new computers and users with really fast internet. If the users does not have these things they face problems like not being able to see the end of someoneâ€™s posts or very slow loading of more material or a page.</p>
