			<h2>Storyboard 01</h2>
			<p>For the first storyboard, I learned that it is better to show rather
			than tell in the images, what is happening. The first storyboard was meant
			to be a type of rough draft with stick figures. I also learned that I would
			need to learn what kinds of programs are avaliable for students from low-income
			neighborhoods as well as how students learn of this information.</p>

			<h2>Storyboard 02</h2>
			<p>For the second storyboard, I focused on the social aspects of students,
			and how students don't only have to deal with studying in their everyday lives,
		but also chores and also family matters. I also learned that how the user navigates
	the program and navigates it is an important aspect for the project.</p>
