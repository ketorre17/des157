			<h2>Storyboard 01</h2>
			<p>For the first storyboard, I learned that it is better to show rather
			than tell the situation in the images. The first storyboard was meant
			to be a type of rough draft with stick figures. It was also meant to
			explore a situation a student would need to note information on the go.
			I also learned that I would need to learn what kinds of programs are
			avaliable for students from low-income neighborhoods as well as how
			students learn of this information. Do students learn often from flyers,
			overhead radio, or talks and presentations. If the photo and recording
		 	input as more likely to used, then its organization would need to be well
			designed.</p>

			<h2>Storyboard 02</h2>
			<p>For the second storyboard, I focused on the social aspects of students,
			and how students don't only have to deal with studying in their everyday lives,
			but also chores and other family matters. I also learned that how the user
		 	navigates the program and navigates it is an important aspect for the
			project. I also realized at the end that the storyboards mostly featured
			the input function of the app, rather than the storing of the information
			through email by pdf. This also made me think about the typography of the
			pdf, so it's easy to combine and organize those pdfs.
