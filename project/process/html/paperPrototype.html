			<h2>Paper Prototype 01</h2>
			<p>From having a peer interact with paper prototype 01 was rather than give
			the user a choice of multiple interfaces, it is better to design a single
			interface that is flexible. In the tihs prototype it thought it would be faster for
			the user to be able to choose betwen inputting the event by days of the current week,
 			or if the event is much later, by a monthly calendar. I also learned that I needed
			to be better able to present what the app was about, especially since some of the
			starting screens are ambigious. I also saw that I should probably of have forms of
		 	tool tips that don't require the hover aspect, since my project would be on a
			touch screen smartphone.</p>

			<h2>Paper Prototype 02</h2>
			<p>From having another peer interact with paper prototype 02, I saw that
			I need to focus a lot on how the user would navigate the app, through navigation buttons
			avalible on the screen. The button have to be simple and clear on what their function
			(aka. to submit or to cancel). I also learned from the peer the decreasing the amount of
			of clicks and that users prefer not to change screens when looking for information.
			My challenge is to create an interface the limits the scrolling required by the user, and
			and how many screen changes that they experience. </p>
